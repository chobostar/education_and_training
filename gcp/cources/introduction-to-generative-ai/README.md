## ML

- Machine learning gives the computer the ability to learn without explicit programming.
    - unsupervised ML models
      - no tag
      - looking at the raw data, and seeing if it naturally falls into groups (discovery)
    - supervised ML models
      - Labeled data is data that comes with a tag like a name, a type, or a number
      - learning from past examples to predict future values

## Deep learning

- process more complex patterns than ML
- semi-supervised - process both labeled and un-labeled data

Generative AI is a subset of Deep Learning

Large Language Models (LLMs) are also a subset of Deep Learning

Deep Learning Model Types
- Discriminative (Classify)
  - Used to classify or predict
  - Typically trained on a dataset of labeled data
  - Learns the relationship between the features of the data points and the labels
- Generative (Generate)
  - Generates new data that is similar to data it was trained on
  - Understands distribution of data and how likely a given example is
  - Predict new word in as sequence

# Gen AI

- type of AI that creates new content based on what it has learned from existing content
- the process of learning from existing content is called training and results in the creating of a statistical model

Generative Models:
- language
- image

pattern matching systems - predict next word
